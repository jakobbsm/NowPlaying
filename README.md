# Currently Playing Song to File

If you happen to be using OBS or alike and want to show the currently playing song this might be it for you.

It is inspired by the C# based application [Snip](https://github.com/dlrudie/Snip/).

## Notes

There are currently no features such as unit tests and not everything has been thoroughly tested.
While it does support Google Music Desktop Player it will not run without initializing Spotify once, and as such needs to be configured.

Creating a Spotify App is as such required and can be done in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).
